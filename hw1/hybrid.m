function x = hybrid(f, dfdx, xmin, xmax, tol1, tol2)
%{
Find the root of the function within given interval using a combination of bisection and Newtonâ€™s method.
Inputs
    f: Function whose root is sought.
    dfdx: Derivative function.
    xmin: Initial bracket minimum.
    xmax: Initial bracket maximum.
    tol1: Relative convergence criterion for bisection.
    tol2: Relative convergence criterion for Newton iteration.
Output
    x: Estimate of root.
Requires
    One and only one root exists in given interval.

function x = bisectSolve(f, xmin, xmax, tol)
%{
Find the root of the function within given interval using bisection recursively.
Inputs
    f: Function whose root is sought.
    xmin: Initial bracket minimum.
    xmax: Initial bracket maximum.
    tol: Relative convergence criterion.
Output
    x: Estimate of root.
Requires
    One and only one root exists in given interval.

%{
Find a root of the function within given interval using Newton's method.
Inputs
    f: Function whose root is sought.
    dfdx: Derivative function.
    x0: Initial guess for the root.
    tol: Relative convergence criterion.
    niters: Maximum number of iterations.
Output
    x: Estimate of root.
Requires
    The initial guess is a good guess (i.e. close enough to the root).
    The function is well-behaved near its root.
